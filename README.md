## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Step-by-step execution of algorithms.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Follow the execution of each algorithm with detailed step-by-step explanations.
- **Queue and Stack Algorithms:** Learn about operations on queues and stacks.
- **Custom Input:** Users can input their own data to see how algorithms handle specific cases.
- **Visual Representation:** Watch as elements are pushed onto and popped off the stack, with visual cues for better understanding..

## Installation

To run Algorithm Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
3. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
   npm start
4. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
    ```bash
   http://localhost:3000

## Usage

- **Select Algorithm:** Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
- **Set Parameters:** Adjust parameters such as stack size, input values, and algorithm speed.
- **Run:** Start the visualization to see the algorithm in action.
- **Step Through:** If desired, step through the algorithm one operation at a time for a more detailed understanding.
- **Reset:** Reset the visualization to its initial state to try different inputs or algorithms.
